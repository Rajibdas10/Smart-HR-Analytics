## 📊 How to Run

To replicate and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open a terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajibdas10/Smart-HR-Analytics.git
   cd Smart-HR-Analytics
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. If you don't have them, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
   - Open Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Navigate to the file:  
     **`Smart HR Analytics-Employee Attrition Insights in Consulting Firms using Predictive Modeling.ipynb`**  
     and run the notebook cells step by step.

4. **View the Results**  
   - The notebook contains all preprocessing steps, visualizations, and model results.
   - Check insights and key findings displayed as output or in the provided executive summary files.
